I made some dope shit. Made a recipe website starring various types of stews.
I used basic HTML commands and learned about how the END button can get instantly set my cursor to the end of a line.
That was important because writing shit in HTML would sometimes trap me in the tags.
Unfortunately my labtop keyboard's end button is in the numpad and needs to be clicked with a shift
which makes things a little uncomfortable.

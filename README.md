# odin-recipes

I made some dope shit. Made a recipe website starring various types of stews.
I used basic HTML tags and linked them all together and it looks like ass but job done.
I also found out a little trick on how to get out of tags in HTML, a basic press of END will set your cursor to the end of the current line.
That was useful but a little awkward for me since the end button is in my labtop's numpad and it done by pressing SHIFT + 1.
